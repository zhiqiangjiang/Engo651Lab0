2. **destinations.html:** Lists ordered by visited places with descriptions.
3. **gallery.html:** Features a responsive Bootstrap carousel displaying photos from different trips.
4. **contact.html:** Provides contact information and an inquiry form arranged using the Bootstrap grid system.

## Bootstrap Components & Grid Model
