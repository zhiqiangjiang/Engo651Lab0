# My Travel Adventures

This personal webpage project showcases my travel experiences around the world. It's built using HTML5, Bootstrap 4, and SCSS.

## Pages

1. **index.html (Home):** Contains an introduction, a hero image, a list of top destinations, and a comparison table.
2. **destinations.html:** Lists ordered by visited places with descriptions and links to more details.
3. **gallery.html:** Features a responsive Bootstrap carousel displaying photos from different trips.
4. **contact.html:** Provides contact information and an inquiry form arranged using the Bootstrap grid system.

## Stylesheet (styles.scss)

- Utilizes SCSS variables, nesting, and inheritance.
- Implements mobile-responsive design with @media queries.
- Applies various CSS properties across multiple selectors.

## Bootstrap Components & Grid Model

- Uses the navigation bar component and collapses it for mobile devices.
- The gallery uses the carousel component.
- Contact details and form are arranged in columns using the Bootstrap grid.

For detailed code implementation, please refer to the respective HTML and SCSS files in this repository.
